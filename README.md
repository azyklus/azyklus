Welcome to my profileâ€”I am so happy you're here!

I use my GitHub account as an archive of many past, present, and probably future projects. Most of these will likely be archived or even deleted at some point,
but I hope that anyone passing by would take the time to support me in some way, possibly by offering constructive criticism or by clicking on one of these buttons:

### Who I Am
<p>
    I am a programmer and a writer. While growing up I learned to code through one of the only
    real role models in my life and have been honing my skills with one project or another almost
    every day since. Most frequently I spend my days writing code for projects both personal and
    freelance, and contributing to other open source projects. I enjoy spending time outdoors hiking
    and walking my dogs, and I generally like to be around other people and make them laugh and smile.
</p>
<p>
    I am always working on various projects that matter to me for one reason or another.
    I have been interested in the inner workings of computers for as long as I can remember,
    and more recently I have become interested in AI and distributed systems. I want to
    experiment with these subjects and see what I can build!
    (see <a href="https://github.com/azyklus/sys3">sys3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/azyklus/t2">Trident</a>)

### How You Can Help
<p>
    If you wish to help, there are a few ways that you can do that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Offer your code. You may fork select projects and make changes to them and submit a pull
        request that I will then review and apply changes on the basis of merit.
        You can also become a contributor to my projects and ensure that my projects
        remain high-quality and unblemished.
    </li>
    <li>
        Offer guidance. If you wish, you may advise me on the direction you think is best for my
        projects to take; I am reachable on any of the platforms I list in the section below.
    </li>
    <li>
        Donate to the cause. You are able to donate to support my work if you feel so inclined.
        All donations I receive will go to supporting my ability to continue working on these projects.
        You can find my donation links in the section below.
    </li>
</ul>

### Getting in Touch
<p>
    If you ever want to reach out, there are a few places that you can find me:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mastodon. (https://elk.zone/mas.to/@zub). Having entirely phased out Twitter, most of my
        nonsense and vague intrigue goes into my Mastodon page now. Mostly, I just repost things that
        matter to me or that grab my attention in some significant way, but I also post updates to
        select projects there as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discord. (https://discord.gg/B9agTdVH4U). My Discord server may just be the best place to find
        me as I am always watching and it is really the only place I do not have notifications disabled
        for altogether. I am King Twit here, so enjoy the show!
    </li>
    <li>
        YouTube. (https://youtube.com/@azyklus). This channel is literally ancient by my very reasonable
        standard, but I do intend to post some of my work in action and some commentary on interesting
        subjects in the tech arena when I get to a more stable point.
    </li>
    <li>
        Twitch. (https://twitch.tv/azyklus). I intend to start streaming as I work on certain projects
        in the future and I will be doing it through Twitch and YouTube.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ko-Fi. (https://ko-fi.com/azyklus). I will accept donations here and will offer some membership
        perks to those willing to help me eek out a living doing the work that matters to me!
    </li>
    <li>
        Patreon. (https://patreon.com/azyklus). I accept donations here as well, though I haven't set up
        proper membership perks yet. This is more of a secondary space since Ko-Fi does not take fees at
        the moment and Patreon does.
    </li>
</ul>

### Thank You
<p>
    I appreciate all the support! If you can find it in your heart to assist an aspiring programmer
    in any way, then I tip my hat to you!
