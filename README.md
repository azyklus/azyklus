## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Malachi, and I am so happy you're here!

Most of my projects on here will probably be archived eventually, for one reason or another, but most of it is here for self-improvement so feel free
to critique it as you see fit. I will likely be better for it.

<br/>

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a bare-bones [operating system](https://github.com/azyklus/sys3) for a series I'm doing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@zaiqi);
- ðŸŒ± I am currently experimenting with the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language;
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate more on open source in general;
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my code, my interests, hobbies, and more;
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [I am on Mastodon!](https://mstdn.social/@azyklus);
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him;
- âš¡ Fun fact: Learned C through my childhood with the help of my uncle.

<br/>

### Who I Am
<p>
    I am an aspiring programmer working on various projects that matter to me for one reason or
    another. I have been interested in the inner workings of computers for as long as I can
    remember, and more recently I have become interested in artificial intelligence and the field's
    implications for the future of computing.
</p>
<p>
    As of 2022 Nov 14, I am twenty years old; I have been working on my skills as a programmer for
    a little over half of my life up to this point, but even then there is a lot that I have not
    been exposed to and I am looking to slowly change that.
    I learned the C programming language throughout my childhood with the help of my uncle who
    has been in the field for my entire life!
</p>

### How You Can Help
<p>
    If you wish to help, there are a few ways that you can do that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Offer your code. You may fork select projects and make changes to them and submit a pull
        request that I will then review and apply changes on the basis of merit.
        You can also become a contributor to my projects and ensure that my projects
        remain high-quality and unblemished.
    </li>
    <li>
        Offer guidance. If you wish, you may advise me on the direction you think is best for my
        projects to take; I am reachable on any of the platforms I list in the section below.
    </li>
    <li>
        Donate to the cause. You are able to donate to support my work if you feel so inclined.
        All donations I receive will go to supporting my ability to continue working on these projects.
        You can find my donation links in the section below.
    </li>
</ul>

### Getting in Touch
<p>
    If you ever want to reach out, there are a few places that you can find me:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Twitter. (https://twitter.com/azyklus). You may find success with me here and you may not.
        I try to avoid using Twitter, though I appear to be addicted to scrolling the feed in my
        downtime, so we will see.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mastodon. (https://mstdn.social/@azyklus). I am hoping to phase out Twitter entirely in favor
        of the Mastodon federation. A decentralized network that cannot be bought out entirely seems
        like a wonderful idea to me in the year of our lord, 2022, with all the controversy behind the curtain at
        Twitter HQ.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discord. (https://discord.gg/B9agTdVH4U). My Discord server may just be the best place to find
        me as I am always watching and it is really the only place I do not have notifications disabled
        for altogether. I am King Twit here, so enjoy the show!
    </li>
    <li>
        YouTube. (https://youtube.com/@azyklus). This channel is literally ancient by my very reasonable
        standard, but I do intend to post some of my work in action on there when I get to that point.
    </li>
    <li>
        Twitch. (https://twitch.tv/azyklus). I intend to start streaming as I work on certain projects
        in the future and I will be doing it through Twitch and YouTube.
    </li>
    <li>
        Instagram. (https://instagram.com/azyklus). I don't post much here except the occasional dog
        picture. Sometimes it is cathartic, other times it is just annoying. You be the judge!
    </li>
    <li>
        Ko-Fi. (https://ko-fi.com/azyklus). I will accept donations here and will offer some membership
        perks to those willing to help me eek out a living doing the work that matters to me!
    </li>
</ul>

### Thank You
<p>
    I appreciate all the support! If you can find it in your heart to assist an aspiring programmer
    in any way, then I tip my hat to you!
