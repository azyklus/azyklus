## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Malachi, and I am so happy you're here!

Most of my projects on here will probably be archived eventually, for one reason or another, but most of it is here for self-improvement so feel free
to critique it as you see fit. I will likely be better for it.

- ðŸŒ± I am currently experimenting with the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language;
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate more on open source in general;
