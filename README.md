## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Malachi, although I prefer to be called Yarot.

I deleted my old GitHub account in 2019, so I cannot offer it as proof of anything I've contributed to in the past.

Most of my projects on here will probably be archived eventually, for one reason or another, but most of it is here for self-improvement so feel free
to critique it as you see fit. I will likely be better for it.

<br/>

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a bare-bones operating system and kernel that I called [TIES](https://github.com/mnimi/t2);
- ðŸŒ± I am currently experimenting with the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language;
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate more on open source in general.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my code, my interests, hobbies, and more.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [I am on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndererZyklus)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Learned C through my childhood with the help of my uncle.
